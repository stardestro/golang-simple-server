# golang-simple-server

 This is a simple example that will allow you to upload a file and download it. The html is non-dynamic so you have to get the name from the directory then past it in the field on the page. This also implements encryption of the files on the server side although a better application would use WASM to encrypt client side before sending it to the server.
